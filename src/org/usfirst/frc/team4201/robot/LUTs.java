	/**	This is a table for the arm angle based off of its voltage.
		Since the DART actuator's linear position does not necessarily linearly correlate with the arm's angle, we use a LUT to determine the angle.
		The formula that calculates these angles is y = 1.21141*x^3-9.29887*x^2+47.7672-84.6061.
		The array uses x = index / 0.02 for a range of 0-5v with <1 degree between each point
		This formula was found by recording a set of angles the arm was at (using a digital level) and the potentiometer voltage at those given angles.
		Alternatively, a linear approximation can work, but it will be +/- 3 degrees off at certain points
		The linear formula would be y = 28.6802*x-76.3477
