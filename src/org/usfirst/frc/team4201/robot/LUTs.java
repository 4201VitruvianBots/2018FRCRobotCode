	 	we get an output angle for the input which we record into this array.
	 	The wrist limits do not follow any intuitive relation due to the intake's geometry, which prevents us from implementing a formula to solve for this.
	 	Additionally, for several of the points when the arm is < 0 degrees from the horizion, we had to increase the limits by an additional 5 degrees because theoretical values != ideal values

	/**	This is a table for the arm angle based off of its voltage.
		Since the DART actuator's linear position does not linearly correlate with the arm's angle, we use a LUT to determine the angle.
		This is calculated by measuring the DART potentiometer's voltage and the arm's angle for several points, then using a best fit of the data.
		The resultant formula is a cubic function, which we then use to generate the LUT.
		The array uses x = index / 0.02 for a range of 0-5v. This gives us ~1 degree of accuracy for every 0.02v of sensed value
		Alternatively, a linear approximation can work, but it will be +/- 3 degrees off at certain points depending on how you fit it.
		We don't do a linear approximation due to how easily our design can break the 16" extension limit.
